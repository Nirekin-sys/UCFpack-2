This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Aimo
* The Aimo are often found in the far, isolated corners of the world. Meditating and exercising their spirituality, violence is a disdained ritual in their society.

  * Unique Unit: Shamanakh
  >Replacing the Great General; the Aimo way of life is always geared towards a pacifistic route, they are however no stranger to those who act otherwise. The Shamanakh are wise people in the Aimo, they are no masters of warfare, but they make up for it by being excellent diplomats in the domestic front and healers in the frontlines.
  
  * Unique Building: Ashram Temple
  >The Ashram Temple is the Aimo's replacement for the Barracks. Reflecting their profoundly peaceful nature; instead of military experience, the Ashram Temple bolsters the civilization's happiness and culture.

### Ordenia
* Secluded in their outposts, the Ordenians are a strict and militarily-austere people. Living out their lives in the harshness of the world has allowed them to temper their society for a martial professionality.

  * Unique Unit: Ordenian Paladin
  >Ordenian Paladins are born and trained to be a self-sufficient force of their own right, owing to the unreliability of their environment. In turn, they are much more resistant to damage and much more recuperative.
  
  * Unique Building: Lazarus Camp
  >The Lazarus Camps are a specialized training and rally point for the Ordenians. Not only training soldiers for the nation, but providing food stores and cultural waypoints for the city it is built for.

### Zakar
* The Zakar are a simple, but formidable people. Living out their lives in the bare aridity of the lands they inhabit through hunting and scavenging has turned them resourceful and rugged.

  * Unique Unit: Huntsman
  >The Huntsman is a strong ancient-era unit of the Zakar, trained in both melee and ranged warfare, they are able to tackle a multitude of tasks in terms of combat, both in matters of range and in close-quarters. A necessity to persevere in the Zakarian homeland.
  
  * Unique Improvement: Poaching Camp
  >The trade of caught, butchered and refined animal products is a prominent part of Zakarian society as this is the founding pillar for riches and supply. Such camps can be found from the most water-trodden bazaars to the green-ridden jungles of the nation.
  
### Alfeon
* An elegant and epicurean society built on the manipulation and production of wealth and trade with themselves and their neighbours. Equally mirrored by their high-spiring buildings and jewelry-cladded citizens.

  * Unique Building: Treasure Coffer
  >It is a known fact that for one to save their wealth, they must store it then spend it. The Treasure Coffers of Alfeon are famed due to the fact that they are shared by the citizens, and are a trustworthy savings in the most dire of times. An insurance so that their society do not run on dry bank.
 
  * Unique Building: Golden Hall
  > A flaunting section of their culture, the Golden Halls are a sign of power, stature and nobility for any city that can build them. Not only do they provide luxury, but they generate and assist the creation of wealth in the nation. As well as pretty pieces of extravagant decoration to an already lavish civilization.
